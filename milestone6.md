Improvements: Make the top navigation bar consistent with that of the home screen. Implemented additional data visualizations to allow the users to switch between data presented and the types of graph/table displayed.

### Data Visualization
The bar graph (image one) displays the clothing usage; the longer the bar, the more that particular clothing item was used. The bubble graph (image two) also displays the clothing usage but the size of the bubble is dependent on the usage; the bigger the bubble, the more the user wore that clothing. The column chart (image three) also displays the clothing usage, but in a column fashion rather than as a bar. The piechart (image four) compares the number of hot, warm, and cold clothing items in the user's closet.
