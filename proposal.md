# Idea #1
A time management and planning app that uses user behavior (i.e. when they eat, when they start homework, etc.) to predict and plan the best schedule for the user. The app incorporate user's calendar, which have a set time block, to plan their daily/weekly routine based on the data input. In short, it's a plan the quarter app, which is based on the first week’s school schedule, and the google calendar to track user’s daily routine and plan the rest of the quarter for them. User can also input deadline which the app will plan accordingly.

# Idea #2
A photo sharing app that allows users to take pictures (sceneries, local festivities, etc.) and display it as a pin or marker on a google map to share it with friends. It can work as a recommendation to friends about places they can visit or determine places user likes to visit and gives other recommendations. Users can also go back through time to savor any past pictures.

# Idea #3
A recommendation app that uses day-to-day weather information (humidity, wind speed, temperature, weather pattern), personal health data (set up in the beginning of the app), and cleaniness of clothing to give recommendations of the perfect clothings to wear.
